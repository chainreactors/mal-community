# CredPrompt
Start Windows credential prompt in an attempt to capture user credentials. Entered credentials are returned as output. The prompt is persistent so the victim can't cancel/close the prompt or enter an empty password. Any user attempt to do so is shown in the output. Finally, a timer is set on the prompt to make sure the beacon will return at some point.
	
>For the duration of the prompt, the beacon is occupied so set a reasonable timer.
