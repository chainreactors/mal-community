# EnumSysmon
Verify if Sysmon is running. This can be done by checking the registry or by enumerating Minifilter drivers and search for one that is associated with Sysmon.

## Options
* `reg`: search the registry to check if Sysmon is present on the system and return the Sysmon service PID if active.
* `driver`: list all the Minifilter drivers on the system and check manually if a minifilter is present that is associated with Sysmon (requires elevated privileges).

## Usage
* `enumsysmon <reg | driver>`
